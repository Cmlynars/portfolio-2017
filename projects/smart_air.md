I worked with a Beijing-based, environmental startup to redesign their visual identity and home page presence on the Taobao online marketplace. The company provides consumer air filters to individuals and families looking for a cheap, effective way to remove harmful pollutants from the air inside their homes. <br><br>

The design distilled complex information about the benefits of the product while simplifying and updating their visual identity to better represent the company’s values and mission.
