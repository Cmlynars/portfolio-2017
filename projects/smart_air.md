<p>I worked with a Beijing-based, environmental startup to redesign the visual identity and home page presence of their store on the Taobao online marketplace. The company provides consumer air filters to individuals and families looking for an inexpensive, effective way to remove harmful pollutants from the air inside their homes and places of work.</p>

<p>The design distilled complex information about the benefits of the product while simplifying and updating the company's visual identity to better represent their values and mission.</p>
